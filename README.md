# RestaurantMenuWithClasses
Restaurant menu with options available for different dishes. This menu uses classes.

This program uses classes to create a menu program. A class order is create. It it has private member: includes order name, (burger, fries, salad, hotdog, and drinks) count, and (burger, fries, hotdog and drinks) toppings. As for the public members they include Get and Set the following: order name, (burger, fries, salad, hotdog, and drinks) count and (burger, fries, hotdog, and drinks) toppings along with menu print, print order to screen, toppings print order to file and order entry functions.

Most of it was ported over from the last the other Restauran Menu program. Most of the funcitons were converted over to class members. I used the this statement to refer to class members and variables.

The biggest issue i have ran into is on the toppings class member. I try to enter a string of toppings which are seperated by whitespace but it wont save to the string variable. I tried different options found on line from gets, cin, getline none will save the string to the string variable. I have resolved the issued by entering one at a time and then concatinating them into one string with a space in between.
